## Final Project

This project had a very long data set.
So training took very long time.
I have applied random forest method to classify the model.
Classe is the outcome and for variables I have used all the columns.
This probably increased the time taken while training.

To measure the quality of workout classe is the best variable.
That's why I have used classe as the output and trained it over all
the other variables. 
Now to model the data I have used random forest because with my little 
knowledge about algorithms I think this would be the best algorithm to 
classify peopel based on their behaviours.
